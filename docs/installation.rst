Installation
============

There are three current methods for installing Keylime: the Ansible role, the
Keylime installer or a manual installation.

Ansible Keylime Roles
---------------------

An Ansible role to deploy `Keylime <https://github.com/keylime/keylime>`_
, alongside the `Keylime Rust agent <https://github.com/keylime/rust-keylime>`_

This role deploys Keylime for use with a Hardware TPM.

Should you wish to deploy Keylime with a software TPM emulator for development
or getting your feet wet, use the `Ansible Keylime Soft TPM <https://github.com/keylime/ansible-keylime-soft-tpm>`_
role instead.

Usage
~~~~~

Download or clone `Ansible Keylime <https://github.com/keylime/ansible-keylime>`_
from its repository and follow the usage section.

Run the example playbook against your target remote host(s)::

    ansible-playbook -i your_hosts playbook.yml

TPM Version Control (Software TPM)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Ansible Keylime Soft TPM** provides a role type for 2.0 TPM
versions.

TPM 2.0 support can be configured by simply adding
the role in the `playbook.yml` file `here <https://github.com/keylime/ansible-keylime/blob/master/playbook.yml#L11>`_

For TPM 2.0 use::

    - ansible-keylime-tpm20


This rule uses the TPM 2.0 Emulator (IBM software TPM).

Vagrant
~~~~~~~

If you prefer, a `Vagrantfile` is available for provisioning.

Clone the repository and then simply run::

    vagrant up --provider <provider> --provision

For example, using libvirt::

    vagrant up --provider libvirt --provision


For example, using VirtualBox::

    vagrant up --provider virtualbox --provision

Once the VM is started, vagrant ssh into the VM and run `sudo su` - to
become root.

You can then start the various components using commands::

    keylime_verifier
    keylime_registrar
    keylime_agent


Rust agent
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. note::
    The Rust agent is the official agent for Keylime and replaces the Python implementation.
    For the rust agent a different configuration file is used (by default `/etc/keylime/agent.conf`)
    which is **not** interchangeable with the old Python configuration.

Installation instructions can be found in the `README.md <https://github.com/keylime/rust-keylime>`_ for the Rust agent.

Keylime Bash installer
----------------------

Keylime requires Python 3.6 or greater.

Installation can be performed via an automated shell script, `installer.sh`. The
following command line options are available::

    Usage: ./installer.sh [option...]
    Options:
    -k              Download Keylime (stub installer mode)
    -m              Use modern TPM 2.0 libraries; this is the default
    -s              Install & use a Software TPM emulator (development only)
    -p PATH         Use PATH as Keylime path
    -h              This help info


Docker - Deployment
--------------------

The verifier, registrar and tenant can also be deployed using Docker images.
Keylime's official images can be found `here <https://quay.io/organization/keylime>`_.
Those are automatically generated for every commit and release.

For building those images locally see
`here <https://github.com/keylime/keylime/blob/master/docker/release/build_locally.sh>`_.

Manual
------

Keylime requires Python 3.6 or greater.

Python-based prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following Python packages are required:


* cryptography>=3.3.2
* tornado>=5.0.2
* pyzmq>=14.4
* pyyaml>=3.11
* requests>=2.6
* sqlalchemy>=1.3
* alembic>=1.1.0
* packaging>=20.0
* psutil>=5.4.2
* lark>=1.0.0
* pyasn1>=0.4.2
* pyasn1-modules>=0.2.1
* jinja2>=3.0.0
* gpg (Note: the GPG bindings must match the local GPG version and therefore this package should not be installed via PyPI)
* typing-extensions>=3.7.4 (only for Python versions < 3.8)

The current list of required packages can be found `here <https://github.com/keylime/keylime/blob/master/requirements.txt>`_.

All of them should be available as distro packages. See `installer.sh <https://github.com/keylime/keylime/blob/master/installer.sh>`_
for more information if you want to install them this way. You can also let Keylime's `setup.py`
install them via PyPI.


TPM 2.0 Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Keylime uses the Intel TPM2 software set to provide TPM 2.0 support.  You will
need to install the tpm2-tss software stack (available `here <https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-tss>`_) and
tpm2-tools utilities available `here <https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-tools>`_.
See README.md in these projects for detailed instructions on how to build and install.

The brief synopsis of a quick build/install (after installing dependencies) is::

    # tpm2-tss
    git clone https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-tss.git tpm2-tss
    pushd tpm2-tss
    ./bootstrap
    ./configure --prefix=/usr
    make
    sudo make install
    popd
    # tpm2-tools
    git clone https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-tools.git tpm2-tools
    pushd tpm2-tools
    ./bootstrap
    ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
    make
    sudo make install


To ensure that you have the recent version installed ensure that you have
the `tpm2_checkquote` utility in your path.

.. note::
    Keylime by default (all versions after 6.2.0) uses the kernel TPM resource
    manager. For kernel versions older than 4.12 we recommend to use the tpm2-abrmd
    resource manager (available `here <https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-abrmd>`_).

How the TPM is accessed by tpm2-tools can be set using the `TPM2TOOLS_TCTI` environment
variable. More information about that can be found
`here <https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-tools/blob/master/man/common/tcti.md>`_.

Talk to the swtpm emulator directly::

    export TPM2TOOLS_TCTI="mssim:port=2321"


To talk to the TPM directly (not recommended)::

    export TPM2TOOLS_TCTI="device:/dev/tpm0"


Install Keylime
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You're finally ready to install Keylime::

    sudo python setup.py install


Database support
---------------------

Keylime supports the following databases:

* SQLite
* PostgreSQL
* MySQL
* MariaDB

SQLite is configured as default (`database_url = sqlite`) where the databases are stored under `/var/lib/keylime`.

Starting with Keylime version 6.4.0 only supports SQLAlchemy's URL format to allow a more flexible configuration.
The format for the supported databases can be found in the SQLAlchemy
`engine configuration documentation <https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/core/engines.html#database-urls>`_.
