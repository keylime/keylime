RESTful API for Keylime (v3.0)
------------------------------

API version 3.0 introduces push-model attestation, where agents initiate
connections to the verifier and proactively submit attestation evidence.

Unlike previous API versions where the agent exposed HTTP endpoints for the
verifier to poll, in v3.0 the agent acts as a client. The v3.0 endpoints are
served by the **verifier only**. The push-model agent does not expose an API.

For a conceptual overview of push-model attestation, see
:doc:`../../design/push_model`.

.. warning::
    Push-model attestation is currently experimental. The API may change in
    future releases.
