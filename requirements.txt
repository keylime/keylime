# Changes to this file first require that an enhancement be raised to ensure new packages are maintained and available in the major distributions
# we support (currently Fedora and Debian). The enhancement should specifically outline the package name and rationale for adding the depedency.
# Once an enhancement has been merged, the package needs to be added to the installer.sh, the CI Docker images and issues should be raised on
# keylime/keylime-rpm keylime/keylime-deb and the keylime ansible installer
