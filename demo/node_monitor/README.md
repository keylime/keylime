# Node Monitor Demo

## Introduction 

The Node Monitor demo is designed to provide a way for nodes to "phone home", indicating that they have successfully been provisioned.  

It consists of three parts: 
* **autorun.sh**: This file is sent to the cloud node, to be executed during provisioning 
    * *__NOTE:__ Your keylime.conf file's ```cloud_node.payload_script``` should be set to autorun.sh*
* **tenant_node_monitor.py**: The Node Monitor server that listens for phone-home requests.  
    * Should be run on the **_same filesystem_** as the tenant (since it shares its CA certs) 
* **tenant_node_monitor.sh**: The script that the Node Monitor executes each time it receives a phone-home (it is the 'action' portion of phoning home) 

## Usage 

The Node Monitor server can be started with the following options: 
```
Usage: python tenant_node_monitor.py [option...]
Options:
-p PORT         Port for the Node Monitor to listen on (defaults to 6892)
-i IP           IP address for the Node Monitor (defaults to localhost)
-s SCRIPT       Specify the script to execute when the node phones home
-c CA_DIR       Tenant-generated certificate. Pass in the CA directory or 
                use "default" to use the standard dir
-h              This help info
```

For example: 
```
python tenant_node_monitor.py -s tenant_node_monitor.sh
```
