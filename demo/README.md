# Deluxe Demo Bundle Setup

## Introduction 

The Deluxe Demo Bundle shows off the fancy technology that Keylime is capable of.  It is intended to be installed on a throwaway demo machine! 

It includes the following demos: 
* IMA Demo 
* Webserver Demo (using nginx) 
* TrustedGRUB Demo 

The bundle contains the following files: 
* **demo_setup.sh**: This sets up and installs the demos (on top of an existing Keylime installation) 
* **ima-policy**: IMA policy file (less burdensome than the IMA TCB policy) 
* **keyfile.txt**: Keyfile that decrypts the payload.enc and payload.txt files 
* **autorun.sh**: This file is sent to the cloud agent, which will decrypt and mount the payload.enc 
    * *__NOTE:__ Your keylime.conf file's ```cloud_agent.payload_script``` should be set to autorun.sh*
* **payload.enc**: The target of the mount.sh script (LUKS encrypted payload), containing the "protected" website 
* **payload.txt**: A simple encrypted payload to demonstrate the "Keyfile" payload type 
* **payload/**: Directory containing the "unprotected" website 

Also, see the **demo/agent_monitor** directory for a agent "phone-home" demo! 

## Usage 

The demo_setup.sh script can be executed with the following options: 
```
Usage: ./demo_setup.sh [option...]
Options:
-p PATH         Use PATH as Keylime path
-i              Install IMA-related demo
-w              Install webserver-related demo
-t              Install TrustedGRUB2 (i386-pc w/ TPM) to /dev/sda
-T PATH         Install TrustedGRUB2 (i386-pc w/ TPM) to PATH
-n              No-password sudo for current user
-N USER         No-password sudo for user USER
-f              Full install (same as -niwt)
-y              No confirmations (feeling lucky)
-h              This help info
```

## Important Notes

### Webserver Demo

Both the keyfile.txt and autorun.sh files should be sent to the agent (via "CA Dir" mode provisioning).  

`keylime_tenant -t 192.168.0.100 -u my_agent_id --cert default --include agent_files_dir`

The payload.enc file should be in the web server HTML directory (demo_setup.sh will put it there). 

### TrustedGRUB

Defaults to using https://github.com/Rohde-Schwarz-Cybersecurity/TrustedGRUB2 

Caveats: This requires a physical TPM, otherwise your system will be *unbootable*.  
It also does not support UEFI mode booting, so make sure you are using legacy boot in your BIOS settings.  
It will be built for the i386-pc platform.

### No-password sudo

Obviously a bad idea unless done on a scrappable, demo-only system!
